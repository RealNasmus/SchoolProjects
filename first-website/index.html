        And I do not condone his opinion, But at a same time, 
        should a legacy that is bigger then the person be detroyed beacuse its his face?
        should we cancel anyone as soon as they have an unpopular opinion?
        or should  we keep this Perfect work of art for what it has become.
        Keep it for the legacy of what we made it instead of what he is!
